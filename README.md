I created a Tamagotchi Application, It Allows users to interact with their virtual pets on their Mobile devices.I created this App for users to be able to interact with pets on their smartphones.Firstly on the Application that i created you will reach a welcome page that displayed a Next page button.when you click the Next Page button it will generate you to the second page which displays 3 buttons which is "Eat,Bath and clean" whenever you click those 3 buttons, one by one it will display a picture that the button defines the pet to do.For example when you click the play button, it will display a picture of a pet playing for a few seconds then it goes back to the "Make the pet happy"Page and each of the progress bar of the buttons will increase as you click multiple times.whenever you click each and every buttons until they reach 50% it will generate to the third page which will write a message and display it with the picture like "Your Pet is Happy"and a go back button hat says "Take care of your pet Again" so that you can play the game Again,That is how the Application operates
